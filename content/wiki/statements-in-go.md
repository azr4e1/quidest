A statement is simply an instruction to Go to do something.

E.g.:
```golang
b = Book{Title: "The Making of a Butterfly"}
```

In Go, almost all our code must be inside some function, and no statements are allowed outside functions (at package level). The only kind of code allowed outside a function is a declaration ([declaration-in-go](/wiki/declaration-in-go/)).
