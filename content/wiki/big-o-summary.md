| Big-O | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| O(1) | constant | *Best* The algorithm always takes the same amount of time, regardless of how much data there is. Example: Looking up an item in a list by index |
| O(log n) | logarithmic | *Great* Algorithms that remove a percentage of the total steps with each iteration. Very fast, even with large amounts of data. Example: Binary search |
| O(n) | linear | *Good* 100 items, 100 units of work. 200 items, 200 units of work. This is usually the case for a single, non-nested loop. Example: unsorted array search. |
| O(n log n) | "linearithmic" | *Okay* This is slightly worse than linear, but not too bad. Example: mergesort and other "fast" sorting algorithms. |
| O(n^2) | quadratic | *Slow* The amount of work is the square of the input size. 10 inputs, 100 units of work. 100 Inputs, 10,000 units of work. Example: A nested for loop to find all the ordered pairs in a list. |
| O(n^3) | cubic | *Slower* If you have 100 items, this does 100^3 = 1,000,000 units of work. Example: A doubly nested for loop to find all the ordered triples in a list. |
| O(2^n) | exponential | *Horrible* We want to avoid this kind of algorithm at all costs. Adding one to the input doubles the amount of steps. Example: Brute-force guessing results of a sequence of n coin flips. |
| O(n!) | factorial | *Even More Horrible* The algorithm becomes so slow so fast, that is practically unusable. Example: Generating all the permutations of a list |
