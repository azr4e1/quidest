# Daily Checklist

A CLI app that only displays daily checklist; you are meant to create your todos for the day at the start of your day. You can import your stale todos from the day before, but the idea is that each todo is supposed to be done on the day, and every new day is a blank slate.

Features:

- ability to sort tasks
- subtasks
- ability to carry over stale todos to the next day (all or selectively)
- every day is a blank slate
- show all completed tasks by day
- CLI interface
- TUI
- JSONL storage
- configuration file
- checklist templates
