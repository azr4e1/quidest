[Markov Chains](/wiki/markov-chains/) are widely used in various machine learning applications, particularly in modeling sequential or time-series data where the assumption of the Markov Property is reasonable.

## Hidden Markov Models

A Hidden Markov Model is a statistical model where the system being modeled is assumed to follow a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. HMMs are used in tasks such as speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and bioinformatics.

## Reinforcement Learning

In Reinforcement Learning (RL), the environment is often modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is an extension of a Markov Chain. An MDP includes actions and rewards, where an agent interacts with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

## Monte Carlo Markov Chain

MCMC methods are used to generate samples from a probability distribution by constructing a Markov Chain that has the desired distribution as its stationary distribution. These samples can be used in Bayesian inference, which is crucial in many machine learning algorithms.
