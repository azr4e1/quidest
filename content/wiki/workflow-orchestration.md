Kestra is an open-source, event-driven orchestration platform that simplifies building both scheduled and event-driven workflows. By adopting Infrastructure as Code practices for data and process orchestration, Kestra enables you to build reliable workflows with just a few lines of YAML.

Orchestration is like a musical orchestra: you have different instruments that make different sounds that need to play at different times and different orders. An orchestra is successful only if it has a conductor, someone that can stand in the middle and make sure that all of these instruments know exactly when they need to come in and at what point.

This is the same with pipelines and scripts: we have many different scripts that do different things to achieve a final result, but running them independently is only a small part of the job; the main part is to get them to work together and make sure they can rely on one another.

Kestra is an all in one orchestration platform that allows you to perform:

- ETL/ELT
- API Orchestration
- Scheduled & Event driven Workflows
- Batch Data Pipelines
- Interactive Conditional Inputs

Kestra can be no-code, low-code or full-code.

Kestra allows you to write in any language you want. It separates the orchestration logic from the code logic.
