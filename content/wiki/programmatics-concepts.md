**Buyer**: This is the advertiser

The buyers operate on the demand-side of things, on a

**DSP**: Demand-Side Platform; used by buyers to define their
campaigns, load creative assets, and manage bidding prices

From marketing side, buyer have:

-   identified audience
-   uploaded creatives
-   bid prices

This is done through an agency or in-house team in what is called a
**Trading Desk**

On the other side of the system we have the

**Publishers**: any site that shows ads to users. By
showing ads, they monetize their content. They have the audience/users,
and need to show them the ads. They are considered *supply side*, so
they use

**SSP**: Supply Side Platform; used by publishers to list their
available ad inventory, ad sizes and payment terms

The publisher relies on a **ad server** to provide ads to
their users. The ad server communicates to SSP when ad is needed. SSP
contacts an Ad Exchange to see what campaigns are targeting the users
who is loading the ad.

Publishers can have direct contracts or agreements with certain
advertisers giving them priority. This is called
**Programmatic Direct**: the pool of advertisers
is smaller.

A publisher can also have a *private exchange*, where they only offer ad
impressions to preferred advertiser. They can restrict who have access
to their ad inventory.

Another options is for the publishers to use their ad servers, or go out
and use many ad networks and reseller networks.

**Ad Exchange**: where publishers can offer their ad
inventory to widest range of advertisers and have transparency on
prices. This maximizes revenue for publishers.

**Ad networks** are company that connect advertisers to
sites with ads. **Reseller Networks** is where
companies buy ad space in advance, and then resells it at higher price.
**Arbritrage** is when resellers make money by purchasing
low cost ad space, and selling at higher rate.

In the ad exchange, advertisers compete with each other through
**Real-Time Bidding (RTB)**. They bid on the
CPM. The highest bid wins the auction.
