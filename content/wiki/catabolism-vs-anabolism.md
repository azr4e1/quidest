Catabolism and Anabolism are two of the many processes of metabolism as a whole.

**Catabolism** is what happens when you digest food and the molecules break down in the body for use as energy. Large, complex molecules in the body are broken down into smaller, simple ones. An example of catabolism is glycolysis. This process is almost the reverse of gluconeogenesis.

Hormones involved in catabolic processes:

- adrenaline
- cortisol
- cytokines
- glucagon

**Anabolism** centers around growth and building — the organization of molecules. In this process, small, simple molecules are built up into larger, more complex ones. An example of anabolism is gluconeogenesis. This is when the liver and kidneys produce glucose from noncarbohydrate sources.

Hormones involved in anabolic processes:

- estrogen
- testosteron
- growth hormone
- insulin

Since anabolism and catabolism are parts of your metabolism, these processes affect your body weight. When you’re in an anabolic state, you’re building and maintaining your muscle mass. When you’re in a catabolic state, you’re breaking down or losing overall mass, both fat and muscle.
