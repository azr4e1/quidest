How to influence how the consumer moves within the [marketing funnel](/wiki/marketing-funnel)?

We map marketing effort to each stage of the funnel, that we push the
consumers in the right direction and we don\'t do anything to hamper
that progression.

But we need to understand the buyer\'s journey: if you know that, you
know where to deploy solutions. The funnel is the bigger picture, but we
need to understand everything in-between.

The journey in the funnel needs to be systematic.

Loyalty is when after a user converts, if they stick around and show
loyalty to your brand.

Customers can move up and down the funnel. Many variables to account for
in the decision making process of the prospect.

Evaluate journey inside and outside the brand.

What increases the positive perception of the brand is
**tact**: knowing what they need in their journey, convincing
them you understand their needs and you are authentic in your ability to
give them what they are looking for.

Best marketing maps consumers journey and identifies when consumers will
cross into your funnel.
