Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.

## Key Features

- **Batch/streaming data**: Unify the processing of your data in batches and real-time streaming, using your preferred language: Python, SQL, Scala, Java or R.
- **SQL analytics**: Execute fast, distributed ANSI SQL queries for dashboarding and ad-hoc reporting. Runs faster than most data warehouses.
- **Data science at scale**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on petabyte-scale data without having to resort to downsampling
- **Machine learning**: Train machine learning algorithms on a laptop and use the same code to scale to fault-tolerant clusters of thousands of machines.
