If we don't have the data to train our ML, we can use Google's pre-trained APIs. These allow you not to worry about the implementation, but provided a standardized way to interact with a service. They save time and effort.

Some APIs provided by GCP are:

- Natural Language API: recognize entities and sentiment in a sentence
- Speech-to-Text API
- Text-to-Speech API
- Translation API
- Vision API: recognize content in images
- Vision intelligence API: motion and action in video
- Document AI API: text extraction and form parser
- Document warehouse API
- Dialogflow API: builds conversational interfaces
- Generative APIs: Gemini multimodal, embeddings multimodal, Gemini for text and chat, Imagen for image, Chirp for speech, Codey for code
