Dataproc is a fast, easy-to-use, fully-managed cloud service for running [Apache Spark](/wiki/apache-spark) and [Apache Hadoop](/wiki/apache-hadoop) clusters in a simpler, more cost-efficient way. Operations that used to take hours or days take seconds or minutes instead. Create Dataproc clusters quickly and resize them at any time, so you don't have to worry about your data pipelines outgrowing your clusters.
