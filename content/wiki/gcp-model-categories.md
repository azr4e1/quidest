Let's clarify difference between _Artificial Intelligence_ and _Machine Learning_.

## Artificial Intelligence

Umbrella term related to anything related to computers mimicing human intelligence.

Examples:

- robots
- self driving cars


## Machine Learning

It's a subset of AI which allows computers to learn without explicitly programmed, in contrast to traditional programming where the computer is told explicitly what to do.

Examples:

- Supervised Learning: uses label data, is task driven, and identifies a goal
  1. Classification (e.g. logistic regression)
  2. Regression (e.g. linear regression)
- Unsupervised Learning: uses unlabeled data, is data driven, and identifies patterns.
  1. Clustering (k-means)
  2. Association (a priori)
  3. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
