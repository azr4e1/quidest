_Unstructured data_ is information stored in a non tabular format such as documents, audio and video files. This type data is usually suited for [Cloud Storage](/wiki/gcp-google-cloud-infrastructur)

Structured data is data stored into tables, rows and columns. This data comes into two types: _transactional workloads_ and _analytical workloads_.

- Transactional Workloads: fast updates to the dataset (web processing) which only impacts few rows
- Analytical Workloads: online analytical processing systems; the entire dataset needs to be read, and queries are complex and impact many rows
