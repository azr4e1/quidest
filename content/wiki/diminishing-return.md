In a production process, as a production factor increases, the amount of
total output increases, but it will reach an optimal output level before
it begins to decrease or diminish. Production factors include inputs
such as labor, machine hours, and raw material.

Assuming a constant level of other production factors, every additional
unit of a production factor leads to a greater increase in total output
(marginal output) *initially*. After reaching a certain optimal
production level, every additional unit of the production factor will
result in a smaller increase in total output with a _diminishing marginal
output_, as the efficiency is limited by the other production factors.

The **Point of Diminishing Returns**
refers to a point after the optimal level of capacity is reached, where
every added unit of production results in a smaller increase in output.
According to the law of diminishing marginal returns, increasing a
factor of production doesn\'t always lead to increased marginal
productivity. The point of diminishing returns can be identified by
taking the second derivative of the production function.
