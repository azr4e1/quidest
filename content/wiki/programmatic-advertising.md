What is programmatic advertising?

> It is the automated buying and selling of digital media.

You define your target audience, match an ad to that, set a budget, and
let the computers do the rest.

## The scope of programmatic 

In the past, an advertiser who wanted to reach an audience had to

-   Find a publisher who has that audience
-   Suitable audience appeal (like popular websites for that audience)
-   Negotiate ad placement (like website banners)
-   Create insertion order to define the campaign
-   New insertion order for changes
-   Deal with agencies

Big publishers demanded more money, small publishers had very little
leverage.

Landscape started to change when advertising tech tracked user behavior
with cookies, and devices identifier. Large Databases allowed to
associate a device to an internet user that matched certain criteria.
Once systems could see what websites a user browses, and create a
profile, Ads target the person, not the website.

Instead of building massive campaign on few websites with the hope the
target audience would see it, advertisers can now target audience based
on demographic or online activity.

This benefits all parties involved.

Advertisers can target people that fit their profile, and make changes
in real-time.

Publishers can monetize by showing ads, and small publisher don\'t have
to compete

No more contract or negotiations, but a system of biddings and payouts.

This is programmatic advertising

## Where does Data come from? 

Internet users have digital fingerprints.

[HTTP protocol](/wiki/what-is-http) is the *hyertext transfer protocol*.

When computer requests file online, there is an exchange in place:

-   computer requests page by clicking a link
-   requests goes to the server hosting the website
-   server responds by saying that the page is available, but it needs
    identification
-   Computer responds by giving IP address, time zone, language, device
    and MAC, OS and version, browser, screen resolution, fonts, ad
    blockers and more. And cookies. All of this is the *browser
    fingerprint*.
-   server gives the page, and then asks if the page arrived
-   computer responds accordingly

This happens for every page, image, file of the page. This process
repeats 10-20 times on a single page.

The purpose is to ensure proper delivery of the page to the computer.

This is useful for analytics for website owners. Cookies enable users to
create accounts and have preferences.

With the aid of databases that keep and update millions of records,
third parties access this data protocol through online trackers, cookies
and advertising systems.

Results is massive databases with information of what people do online.

## Data and behavioral Targeting 

Programmatic is **the process of buying and selling digital media in an automated fashion**

The most common programmatic system is search engine ads (Paid Search
Ads):

-   Search engine results
-   paid when user clicks
-   relevant to the searcher
-   triggered by keywords

The ads are targeted and depend on the search keyword you used

Programmatics take this to the next step: it targets ads on search
terms, browsing behavior and content of pages you read. When people see
behaviorally targeted ads, [CTR](/wiki/marketing-acronyms) is 600% higher than non-targeted ads.

Data has to be gathered to reach this level of personalisation: through
first-party sources, like

-   websites you visit
-   online retailers you visit

or through third-party sources, like

-   ad trackers
-   aggregators

These track millions of users and associate the data to the browsers
digital fingerprint.

Data is collected, stored and analysed to create user segments. From
these segments, audiences are created: like *travelers* or *health and
fitness*

Then advertisers create campaigns to match these audiences based on
behavioral profiles.

Programmatic ads are not just static media ads: they are interactive
media, videos and more.

By matching message to audience based on browsing history and interests,
advertisers create more effective campaigns.

## Programmatic advertising and first-party data 

A critical aspect is respect of people\'s data and preferences. Handling
of data must comply with local and global regulations. There are three
types of data:

1.  First party data. Data gathered from
    -   your website
    -   your campaigns
    -   your contacts and customers
    -   your CRM
2.  Second party data. Someone else\'s first party data, sold or
    published. Gathered from
    -   Partnerships
    -   Shared campaigns
    -   co-operative campaigns
    -   someone else\'s first party data
3.  Third party data. Non identifying data aggregated from multiple
    sources

In Programmatic Advertising, the main source of third-party data is the
*Data Management Platform* (DMP)

GDPR defines how to use third-party data

First-party data yields the highest ROI; it is more accurate and more in
depth. Cookies are safe.

Third-party data will become more difficult to obtain, less reliable and
more restrictive because of privacy concerns.

## Retarget in programmatic marketing 

Some key concepts:

**Audience**: defined by targeting criteria. For
programmatics, criteria can be

-   keywords
-   demographics
-   behavior
-   websites visited
-   content viewed
-   etc

**Creative**: what will be shown to the audience. It can be

-   Search ads (text)
-   Display ads(images or rich media)
-   pop-ups (images or high media)
-   video ads (video)

In creating the campaign the advertiser develops the creative and
defines which creative will be used where, and how to target the
audience.

**Bidding (payment)**: the campaign parameters
define the cost of reaching the audience. Bidding refers to

-   The amount the advertiser is willing to pay to reach intended
    audience.
-   Priced at []{#CPM = cost per mille}**CPM = cost per mille** \-- cost
    per 1000 impressions

**Automation Platform**: the engine that makes
it happen. In search ads, it\'s Google Ads or Bing Ads. This is the
system the advertisers use to reach their audience across multiple
websites and publishers.

Search engine ads are programmatic, and so is **retargeting**: if you add something to the basket and
don\'t check out, you will see that product in an ad in the next few
days. One of the easiest programmatics to develop.

**Retargeting**: User browses a website that serves
cookies. Cookies record activity of the user

-   User leaves website
-   Identified on another website that serves ads (making use of
    cookies)
-   Retargeting campaign is triggered and shows them the ad

The campaign is executed through an advertising platform like Google,
Facebook of Advertising Exchange

## Dealing with Ad Fraud 

**IVT** is invalid traffic: a third of online traffic is bots,
which invalid the advertising effort. A publisher could use bots to
inflate their traffic and make more revenue.

**Malware** in ad fraud opens thousands of browsing window
of the victim browser, using the victim cookies behavior to mimic a bot
and drive more traffic to fraudulent websites, reporting *verified* ad
views. That\'s why malware slow down computers.

To *mitigate* ad fraud, we start small and build
detection:

-   make use of whitelists (verified and safe publishers) and blacklists
    (malicious websites)
-   Look at the data; learn to read and evaluate data: some domains have
    very similar patterns and 100% CTR. These are bots. Blacklist those
    domains.
-   Evaluate ad performance across domains: ads should reach customers
    across wide variety of domains
