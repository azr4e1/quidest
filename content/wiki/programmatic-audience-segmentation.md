Googe dominated the programmatic ad market. Through it various
businesses take advantage of Google\'s vast reach. Google and Facebook
together make up 60% of ad spending. They accumulate huge DMPs tied on
actual user profiles. Google encompasses every step of the programmatic
process internally. Google is both:

-   ad broker
-   DMP
-   Data collection platform
-   Network platform
-   publisher

Advertisers come to Google to setup their campaigns. They can target

-   search ads
-   youtube ads
-   display ads
-   programmatic

etc.

They go to Google because it has users and user data. It has advantage
over DPM because its users are registered with personal info. The chrome
browser also tracks precisely browser history and user behavior. Google
has direct insight into users\' behavior.

Google\'s own **DMP** processes this data into affinity
segments. Advertisers set up campaign according to these segments.

**Ad delivery** is also contained into Google.
Publishers can create advertising accounts on Google and get paid to
display ads on their website. Google places ad inventory on the ad
exchange, enabling everyone to access Google properties and partners.

Google wants to eliminate cookies as primary tracking method, and
develop its own tracking.

## Target Audiences based on Behavior 

Dramatic change in programmatic from targeting demographics to targeting
users which signalled intent to buy through their behavior.

Ads served based on intent signals have a 40% higher purchase intent
lift compared to demographics alone.

Consumers provide data that shows what they want through their browsing.
An advertisers can target intent creating a model for their campaign,
based on number of pages, type of website, search terms or other
behavioral factors.

When a user reaches a certain trigger threshold of the campaign,
advertisers can show them personalised strategies and creatives.

Advertisers can personalise their campaign based on consumer\'s
behavioral intent.

Research your audience and their intent:

-   what are predictable intent signals?
-   how do people begin their search?
-   what needs trigger the search?
-   how early can you position your ad?

There is no *one size fits all*

## Target audience based on location 

Location can be pinpointed to city, zip or postal code.

Location data is easier to access than ever before. Smartphone allow to
know the exact location of a person.

Maps, apps, searches, etc report location. Find location cues that can
indicate and locate your audience at critical times in their search.

## Targeting audience based on content and context 

The goal pf programmatic is to reach consumers with highly personalized
ads. With no cookies, this becomes focused on contextual placements.
This is what is called **Impression-based
Targeting**. It doesn\'t have to rely on cookies, as it attempts to
reach new audiences, which can be targeted through demographics,
sociographics, contextual and geographical methods.

If I want to sell car insurance to young people, I would look for
websites popular among that demographics. Similarly to sociographics, if
I want to reach affluent people for example.

Contextual based targeting uses the context of the website to target the
audience: sport related website will have sport related ads, etc.

Geographical targeting is based on the location of the consumer to serve
ads.

## Life without Cookies 

In 2020 Google announced that Chrome would not support third-party
cookies in 2022. This means DMP don\'t receive the bulk of their data
through ad-trackers or brand relationships. Shift to advertisers first
party data, and to less data intensive targeting like contextual and
location based targeting.

First alternative for advertisers is to focus their advertising on
quality premium websites. This can be done through Programmatic Direct
buy, where advertisers make direct deal with publishers. The ad request
is only sent to the programmatic direct agencies or advertisers.

Second alternative is contextual targeting.

This moves cements Google\'s position at the centre of ad tech world,
because all the data will go through Google rather than being shared
with third-party trackers. Google can dictate future policy, technology
and tracking methods.

This is good for consumer\'s privacy, as cookies expose lots of personal
information. But this means only Google has exclusive informations on
Chrome\'s users and Google accounts like YouTube.

## Programmatic Pitfalls 

Almost 50% of the money spent by advertisers do not reach publishers,
but are spent in agency and technology fees and other involved costs.
Foe each dollar spent, 0.15p are lost and untraceable. This is a problem
of low quality data inside the industry. Also, 50% of the ads are not
viewable, in the sense that they are not seen by an actual human: either
because they don\'t load, they are out of the screen, or the website is
fraudulent and only created to accumulate advertisers money \-- low
quality website. They can consume a large chunk of the campaign
spending, because advertisers are charged at bidding, and there is no
way to verify that the ads are actually displayed.

To improve the system, we need:

-   transparent metrics
-   verification methods that ads are shown
-   transparent about risks and solution
-   quality rather than quantity
-   programmatic direct
-   preferred networks
