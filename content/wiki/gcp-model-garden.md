Model Garden is like a model library, where you can search, discover, and interact with Google’s, third-parties’, and open-source gen AI models.

If you want to quickly find and apply the right model to solve a problem, Model Garden is a good choice.

Model Garden offers a model card for each model, encapsulating critical details such as overview, use cases, and relevant documentation.

Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with Vertex AI Studio, allowing you to initiate project development through a user-friendly interface.

Additionally, it provides access to sample code and facilitates code development via notebooks.

There are three major categories of models: _foundation models_, _task-specific solutions_, and _fine-tunable_ or _open-source models_.


Model Garden lets you:

- Use Google's foundation models directly through the Google Cloud console with Vertex AI Studio or through code with pre-built APIs.
- Tune models in Vertex AI Studio.
- Deploy models.
- Customize and use open-source models.
